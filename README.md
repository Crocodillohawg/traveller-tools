# traveller-tools
tools for Mongooses 2ed Traveller RPG rules using Scilab/Matlab
This is a hobby project undertaken by a coding novice, I make no money from this.
More often than not the code and results are bloated, ugly, and dirty, but it works reliably. 
I cannot guarantee its accuracy or that it is correct.
If you use any of my code please credit me, especially if used for anything more than a home game.

Props to Mongoose Publishing for continuing an amazing RPG system.
